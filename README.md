## Top-20 JavaScript Projects for beginners. 
I am creating this repository for anyone who is willing to learn JavaScript(I am also learning :) it never stops). Let's follow : learning by doing approach and make top-20 JS projects which will eventually help to get better insights of this language.

### `What is JavaScript ?`

The language that *powers the web* by BRENDAN EICH. He first named it livescript, later some called it Jscript therefore ECMASCRIPT(europeans standardised it) and the name became official in 1997. ECMAScript is often abbreviated to ES. We can use the Google Chrome browser as our development environment, because of the excellent developer tools it provides it is awesome to use.

It is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
